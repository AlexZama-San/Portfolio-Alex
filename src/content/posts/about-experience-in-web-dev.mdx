My story..: During my childhood, i always loved anything about computers, from gaming to development in general, and now I'm here, a web developer. I'm going to tell you about my journey from childhood to the present day.
<span class="space-y"></span> 

i received my first computer when I was 10 years old. It was a Pentium 4 with 512MB of RAM and a 40GB hard drive. I was so happy to have it, and I spent all my free time playing games and learning how to use it.

As i grew up, I take some clases in a Local computer school, and i made my High School in a tchenical school, where i learned about C, Java, SQL, JavaScript, and other programming languages

Later, I taught myself how to develop websites using a regular Windows Notepad as my first IDE. Eventually, I learned about Notepad++, Sublime, and even VS Code. 
I became interested in Linux and its distributions, including Ubuntu, i really like linux but i'm not a fan of it, i prefer Windows, but i use it for some tasks.

## It was cool in college
During college, I learned about CSS style sheets, HTML markup language, and web standards. I also learned about JavaScript and its frameworks, such as Vue.JS, Next.JS and the React Library, and how to use them to create dynamic web pages.
i also learned about databases and how to use them, and how to create a REST API with Node.js and Express.js, and how to use it with a database.
actually, my favorite database is MongoDB, but i also use MySQL and PostgreSQL.
also, i learned about the basics of SEO, and how to optimize a website for search engines, and how to use Google Analytics and Google Search Console.

I was drawn to the web because I wanted to show the world what I can do and be useful. 
I studied web development for 4 years, and I'm still learning new things every day, like astro framework, which I'm using to write this site.

## experience
I actually have not much work experience, but I have some experience in web development, I worked for a little team of my companions of the university for 1 year, where I developed some website for a local store

## Our days
Now I'm learning Astro Framework, by the way this site is written on this technology. I plan to practice more with JavaScript, and also to start learning React, in general, I've made up my mind about the stack, although I've come a long way to understand what I really like and what I want. Yes... a long way, but it will be even more interesting in the future.

Thank you for reading to the end, it motivates me to learn and try harder, I wish you a good day and a great mood, I'm on üòâ
